### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
In the meantime, I will be using this username instead of my full name

## What is this repo about: 
I am studying how to build a system that shows the underlying design decisions explicit to their output, their inference to a set of viable solutions, to be generated to comply with requirements, aimed to (in the future) assist design endeavors outside of the perception of "whim" but from a logical approach.  

Can a design be explicit in its measured sources of decision?  
Can a design be solved as a sequence of evaluations?  


## When is a design a good one?

Formally, a design is a method of communication between Sender and Receiver.  

A design is "good" or "bad" depending on whether the Receiver perceiving the design can read the ideas intended to communicate from Sender, by evaluating the properties expressed in it.  

It happens within a comparative evaluation.

The Receiver, when perceiving the design, compares it with one that corresponds to the subject associated with it in his memory.  
Then wonders:  

*"Does this proposal need changes to express better such an idea than the solution I remember that already works?"*

If it answers NO, then the evaluation stops.
What the Receiver remembers does not need any more changes.
As a result, the design is ugly, wrong, whimsical.

If it answers YES, the Receiver is open to modifying the solution in its memory and starts looking for properties.
The evaluation continues.

## A model that simplifies reality

The (human) brain evolved searching for events that repeat themselves following an order, patterns, sequences that could simplify reality.

* Reality: the set of all existing data  
* Senses: the enabled capabilities  
* Memory: what is stored and associated  
* Model: simplified reality  

In the local environment, the sequences exist without differentiation.
The available senses reduce the complexity of reality and make it processable as a local model by detecting measurable events, thus differentiating each one as properties, and events get defined by their perceived values.

Then these pairs of property and value are allocated into memory if required, based on the priority of use or association. Properties get measured according to the value they appear to be worth.
With the property-value pairs in memory, the brain builds and stores a quick access tool to be used when the situation requires it.

## The narrative of design

How the brain parses these sequences correspond to a process of invention, from which are developed tools and processes.

This composition gets communicated as a narrative of properties and values.

If the Receiver is capable to perceive as intended the narrative of the design, then the design will get evaluated as good.

An invention process would be:
* Step 1: Mathematics. Quantification of reality, relationships, concepts of measure, properties of numbers, and proportions. The proposition of ideas as logic constructs.

* Step 2: Language. Ideas get packaged into words, meanings.

* Step 3: Architecture. Structure of requirements of an idea, relationships, properties, and values required in elements that will be transmitted. Define and compose the methods that are available for communicating the idea to the Receiver.

* Step 4: Design. The planning on how to make and deliver something. Configuration of assembly, function, shape, methods.

* Step 5: Delivery. Ability to do, technique, art. Expression, implementation of the idea as a narrative from the design, delivered as a memory message to the Receiver, who as perceives the design deploys the idea into its comparative evaluation.
